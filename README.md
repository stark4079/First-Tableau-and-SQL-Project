First Tableau and SQL Project
===

## Project structure

- **1. SQL Data Exploration**
-- ```CovidDeaths.xlsx``` and ```CovidVaccinations.xlsx```
-- ```EDA with SQL.sql```
- **2. Tableau Dashboard for Covid Exloration**
-- ```Tableau Table x{1-2-3-4}.xlsx```
--```SQL querry for Tableau project```
-- ```Covid Dashboard.twb```
- **3. Data Cleaning by SQL**
--```Data Cleaning by SQL.sql```
-- ```Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning.xlxs```

## Experiences
---
**Project 1: SQL Data Exploration**
1. Import data to MSSQL server by using ```.xlsx``` files
2. Perform some basic aggreation to get overall statistics about covid deaths and vaccinations by country and continent. Learn how to use CTE, Groupby, basic join.

**Project 2: Tableau Dashboard for Covid Exploration**
1. From the previous data on MSSQL server, I extract data from it by querry and copy data into ```.xlsx``` files.
2. Using these files to build each sheet on Tableau, then construct the final dashboard to show the information below:
-- The global numbers of covid.
-- The infected rated of covid each location on map.
-- The total death count ranked by some picked locations.
-- The average population infected changes by time during covid time in four countries including United States, United Kingdom, Mexico and China.

**Project 3: Data Cleaning by SQL**
In this project, I use SQL on MSSQL server to clean data some tasks below:
-- Standarize the datetime.
-- Populate the address on filling missing values.
-- Breaking the adress data into (Address, City, State).
-- Ensure the integrity of```Sold As Vacant``` column by letting it have only 'Yes' or 'No' values.
-- Remove duplicates rows.
